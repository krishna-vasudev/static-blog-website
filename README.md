### What I learned

I understood concepts related to flexbox while working on this challange. 
Using media queries to enhance for the mobile first design was really interesting.
It was my first project in which i was using flexbox, and just made me fall in love with CSS. The most important learning was how to generate beautiful design layouts with less CSS.


Moreover there are several more concepts which taught me much. Take a look at the repo to get an idea of those.
